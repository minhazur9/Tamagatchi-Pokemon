# Project #0: The Game

## User Stories

### Layout

The layout should have a bright purple-like rectangular background for the HUD and a smaller background inside the HUD for the screen.

In the HUD there should be buttons on the bottom left and right corners and one in the middle for feed, sleep, and play. 

The corners and middle should have the hunger, sleepiness, and boredom bar. The age and time should be near the top middle of the HUD too. 

The starting screen background should be sky blue for daytime, the ground should be dirt colored and there should be a sun pixel art in the sky too. It should also have start screen text.
