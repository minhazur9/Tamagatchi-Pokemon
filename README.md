## User Stories

### Layout

The layout should have a bright purple-like rectangular background for the HUD and a smaller background inside the HUD for the screen.

In the HUD there should be buttons on the bottom left and right corners and one in the middle for feed, sleep, and play. 

The corners and middle should have the hunger, sleepiness, and boredom bar. The age and time should be near the top middle of the HUD too. 

The starting screen background should be sky blue for daytime, the ground should be dirt colored and there should be a sun pixel art in the sky too. It should also have start screen text.

There should be an egg thats far from the start text.

### After Pressing Start

The start text should go away.

The three starter pokemon should appear directly above the egg waiting for you to choose one of them.

There should be a border when hovering over one of the pokemon.

After choosing one of them all three should disappear.

The egg should start rotating as if it is hatching.

The screen should fade to white and fade back in with the egg gone and the chosen pokemon replacing it.

### After selection

The time should start ticking as a 24 hour clock, 1 real sec = 1 game min, age up every 5 game days.

The meters should start gradually get shaded in every in game quarter day, which is 6 min.

The sun should start gradually moving down and once it does, the background changes to black and the moon appears.

The moon should do the reverse.
